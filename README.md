## Description
This application is a score-tracking application for ping pong games. It was developed for students in our cohort at Galvanize to keep track their scores.

Users are able to use the application with or without a login. The games are logged in a database and wins/losses are tracked with users if they create accounts. Users can see standings for the top ten rankings in the database on the homepage. The homepage has top five Reddit articles about table tennis. Another feature of this application is the integration with Slack. We set up a separate Slack channel that notifies users when a match has been logged and the scores.
